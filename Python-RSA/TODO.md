# TODO

Minimum deliverables:
* large encryption exponent? 
* large decryption exponent?
* |p – q| > 2(nlen / 2) – 100
* varying modulus?
* Prime Checking? 
	

Key size = 2, 4, 8 too small
Key sizes = 16+, all Public key exponents are 65537. This is because we are using the default function. 

Key size 16= we do get sometimes that the private key exponent is less than 1000

For larger test cases, 128 and above, we see that the n and d are large and they are non-repeating.
